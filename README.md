# Random Tinkering

In this Repo I play around with things that I find fascinating, or
otherwise just fun

Everything in here is in python and I am having fun with it

## Contents

- Algorithms
  - Algorithmic Patterns
- Data Structures
- A "pygame" game that I have not completed

## Why

Because why not, yeah? I had a repo similar to this which I lost. 
This can serve as reference
